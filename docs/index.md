# CDS Hooks

Thank you for your interest in providing feedback on the CDS Hooks 1.0 specification via the [HL7](https://www.hl7.org) [ballot process](http://www.hl7.org/special/committees/publishing/schedules.cfm)!

CDS Hooks has a vibrant community and we are excited to take CDS Hooks into the next phase by incorporating it as an HL7 project. We look forward to the feedback from the larger HL7 community and we know our specification will be better for it.

## May 2018 Ballot

The May 2017 ballot period is open from April 6th, 2018 thru May 7th, 2018. You can review the content for the May 2018 ballot at [https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/ballots/2018May](https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/ballots/2018May)

The following pages are the official ballot content:

- [https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/ballots/2018May/specification/1.0/](https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/ballots/2018May/specification/1.0/)
- [https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/ballots/2018May/hooks/](https://cds-hooks.hl7.org/ballots/2018May/hooks/)

The remainder of the site content is not part of the specification but are supplemental living documentation. We welcome informal feedback on this content.

## Submitting Ballot Comments

Ballot comments can be submitted per normal HL7 processes.

Additionally, we encourage you to submit each distinct comment as a GitHub issue logged to our source repository at [cds-hooks/docs](https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/issues). If you can, please attach the [ballot](https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/labels/ballot) label to your issue (see [GitHub's documentation on attaching labels](https://help.github.com/articles/applying-labels-to-issues-and-pull-requests/)). Please make sure to browse our [existing issues](https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/issues) before logging new issues.

If you don't have a GitHub account or don't want to submit your comment as a GitHub issue, that's fine! We'll do it for you once we receive your comments. :-)

## Following Ballot Discussion

All discussion and resolution of ballot comments will be communicated in an open manner via our GitHub issues, in addition to the process required by HL7. Any discussions that occur in an offline forum (HL7 working group meetings, conference calls, etc), will be communicated on our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cds-hooks) and [Zulip chat](https://chat.fhir.org/) #cds-hooks stream. Summaries of these offline discussions will be posted on each GitHub issue.
