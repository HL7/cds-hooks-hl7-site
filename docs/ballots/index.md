## Submitting Ballot Comments

Ballot comments can be submitted per normal HL7 processes.

Additionally, we encourage you to submit each distinct comment as a GitHub issue logged to our source repository at [cds-hooks/docs](https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/issues). If you can, please attach the [ballot](https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/labels/ballot) label to your issue (see [GitHub's documentation on attaching labels](https://help.github.com/articles/applying-labels-to-issues-and-pull-requests/)). Please make sure to browse our [existing issues](https://github.com/cds-hooks/docs/issues) before logging new issues.

If you don't have a GitHub account or don't want to submit your comment as a GitHub issue, that's fine! We'll do it for you once we receive your comments. :-)

## Following Ballot Discussion

All discussion and resolution of ballot comments will be communicated in an open manner via our GitHub issues, in addition to the process required by HL7. Any discussions that occur in an offline forum (HL7 working group meetings, conference calls, etc), will be communicated on our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/cds-hooks) and [Zulip chat #cds-hooks](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/cds-hooks)  stream. Summaries of these offline discussions will be posted on each GitHub issue.
